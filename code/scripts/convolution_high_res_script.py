"""
Purpose:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We generate convolved hemodynamic neural prediction into seperated txt files for 
all four conditions (task, gain, lost, distance), and also generate plots for 4 
BOLD signals over time for each of them too. We use events2neural_high() in stimuli
because the onsets of condition do not start at TR.

Steps:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Extract 4 conditions of subject 1's first run
2. Gain higher time resolutions
3. Convolve with hrf
4. Plot sampled HRFs with the high resolution neural time course
5. Save to txt files
