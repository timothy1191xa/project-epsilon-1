\section{The data}
\noindent
The data we are using can be found on the OpenfMRI website at the following
address: \url{https://www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds000005}, the dsnum is ds005.
For our project, we are specifically using the behavior data and the BOLD data
that are organized. 
\paragraph
\noindent
For each of runs per subject (3), the behavior data contains the timestamp of
each survey question (onset), the gain/loss combinations (gain and loss), the
response for the particular trial (respnum) from the 4-point likert scale. 
The researcher created a response category (respcat) to be used in their binary
choice model that combines the “reject” answers together on one hand and the 
“accept” answers together on the other hand. BOLD data contains compressed  
4-dimensional brain images for each subject’s run. The folder also comport 
Quality Assurance (QA) files and a report.
