\section{Multi-Comparison}
\subsection{Introduction}
\noindent
After exploring behavior data, we proceed to image data analysis.  First we need to apply convolution to connect behavior stimuli and neural activity. Then we can run general linear regression to find activated voxels across time course. Using hypothesis testing, we can actually locate and visualize the activated voxels. After finishing basic steps, we try to apply noise modeling and PCA to compare the MRSS so that we can finally decide our design matrix.

\subsection{Methods}
Here are some of the methods (this needs to be updated soon as well.)
